# Testing

## Content

## Types

* **Unit tests** that test one isolated unit/ piece of code \(e.g. a function\)

Unit tests are the easiest tests to write because you have some input and can expect some result. There are no dependencies, no complex interactions.

* **Integration tests** which test the combination of features \(e.g. a function calling another function\)

Integration tests are a bit more complex than unit tests because you now have to deal with some dependencies \(e.g. another function that gets called\).

* **End-to-End \(e2e\) or UI tests** which test a full interaction path in your app \(e.g. the signup process\)
