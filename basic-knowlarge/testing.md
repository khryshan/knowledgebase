# Testing

## Types

* **Unit tests** that test one isolated unit/ piece of code \(e.g. a function\)
* **Integration tests** which test the combination of features \(e.g. a function calling another function\)
* **End-to-End \(e2e\) or UI tests** which test a full interaction path in your app \(e.g. the signup process\)

Unit tests are the easiest tests to write because you have some input and can expect some result. There are no dependencies, no complex interactions.
